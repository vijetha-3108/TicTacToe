We structured our code with various functions like createboard(), fixSpot(), getRandomFirstPlayer() and is_player_win() to ensure the reusability of these codes and better readability.

✅ FOR LOOPS IN PYTHON 
These loops played a crucial role for iterating through the positioning of the board and also for checking win conditions. It simplifies the work with a collection of data as it automatically handles the iteration.
